Current supported configuration(s):

* guest: centos 7
* network: flannel

# usage

Create and provision the cluster

```bash
vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

Set the kubectl configuration file

```bash
vagrant ssh master -c "sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf" > ${HOME}/.kube/config
```

Test cluster access from your host

```
[~/src/k8s-vagrant-libvirt]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
master    Ready    master   30m   v1.13.4
worker0   Ready    <none>   30m   v1.13.4
```

# configuration

The following options may be set in the `Vagrantfile`

```ruby
# number of worker nodes
NUM_WORKERS = 1
# number of extra disks per worker
NUM_DISKS = 1
# size of each disk in gigabytes
DISK_GBS = 10
```

# loading docker images

Use the [vagrant-docker_load](https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-docker_load) plugin to upload Docker images into Vagrant machines

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker_load
```

An example of loading a [rook@master](https://github.com/rook/rook) build

```bash
[~/src/k8s-vagrant-libvirt]$ vagrant docker-load build-2568df12/ceph-amd64 rook/ceph:master
Loaded image: build-2568df12/ceph-amd64:latest
Loaded image: build-2568df12/ceph-amd64:latest
```
